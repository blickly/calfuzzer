----

ant -f run.xml deadlockfuzzer

You should run

ant -f run.xml hw2 

to test your implementation of RaceFuzzer.

HOW CAN I WRITE MY OWN ANALYSIS?
--------------------------
Check out the tool paper activetool.pdfpresent in the current directory.

See

src/javato/activetesting/DeadlockFuzzerAnalysis.java
src/javato/activetesting/IGoodlockAnalysis.java

for an implementation of DeadlockFuzzer.  Note that this is not the optimized implementation reported in the PLDI'09 paper.  You need to implement the classes

src/javato/activetesting/RaceFuzzerAnalysis.java
src/javato/activetesting/HybridAnalysis.java


See the target deadlockfuzzer, hw2, test_race1, test_1 in run.xml for details on how to invoke DeadlockFuzzer and RaceFuzzer.
